# CVE-2017-17215
Usage: CVE-2017-12149.py http://targetip:37215/  
I am so poor that cant afford to but a HUAWEI router XD so it is not tested on any machine~  
but the exp technically should be working 

I found this report 
https://blog.newskysecurity.com/huawei-router-exploit-involved-in-satori-and-brickerbot-given-away-for-free-on-christmas-by-ac52fe5e4516
the payload was released 2 weeks ago, and is not by me! scrpkidde go search for the EXP somewhere else.


这SB报道像真的一样. 这漏洞利用早就公开了我自己只是收集一下，这个EXP我TMD的还都没环境演过。
为了避免麻烦我撤掉了。
